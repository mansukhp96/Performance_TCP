########################################Performance of TCP variants####################################################
Analysing the performance of TCP variants such as Reno, Tahoe, Vegas, SACK, NewReno by varying the cbr rate, time and
even the queueing algorithms. We have done 3 experiments - Performance of TCP variants w.r.to throughput, latency and
droprate in experiment 1. Analysis of two variants of TCP over cbr rate w.r.to throughput, latency and droprates.
Finally, in experiment analysing the performance of TCP variants over time while varying the queuing algorithms.

Distribution of work: (For final submission)

Dweep:
-Worked on experiment 2 TCL script and it's working
-Worked on experiment 3 python script to generate the data for the graphs.
-Worked on graph generation for experiment 2.
-Worked on building the report and it's structure and contents to be added.

Mansukh:
-Worked on experiment 1 tcl script and python script for generating data.
-Worked on graph generation for experiment 1 and experiment 3
-Worked on experiment 2 tcl script.
-Worked on adding comments, writing the report, and final packaging for submission.


Challenges faced:
-Understanding the NS2 simulation and TCL scripts.
-Generating the correct data and analysing carefully the values in the trace files.

UPDATE: We did set up an appointment with Berk and explained our methodology for all 3 experiments. Discussed and
cleared doubts regarding the graph generation.

Dweep: 
* Understanding TCL simulator and scripts 
* Designed the overall Network Architecture
* Attach TCP modules to specific nodes
* Started understanding throughput, delay of TCP variants
* Setup FTP Traffic Generator on TCP nodes


Mansukh: 
* Understanding TCL simulator and scripts 
* Designed the overall Network Architecture
* Attach UDP modules to specific nodes
* Started with packet delay of TCP variants
* Setup the CBR Traffic Generator on UDP nodes


We have not yet discussed our methodology with a TA. 


We have reached out to Soumitra to set up a time for discussing our methodology in the upcoming week.
